# Playground

<br>

This repository is designed for my students under CM50175 providing a simple tutorial in directory manipulation and virtual python environments.

There are two demo scripts, `directory-demo.py` and `script-demo.py` which should be executed by the following command

```console
user@device:~$ python3 -m directory-demo
```

followed by

```console
user@device:~$ python3 -m script-demo
```

Please only press ENTER when prompted to do so and practice the commands outside of the demos to make sure you understand the commands!

We will go through how to use the University of Bath's hex cluster in our next meeting but please do ensure you can all sign in with

```console
user@device:~$ ssh <username>@ogg.cs.bath.ac.uk
```

for example, I would execute

```console
user@device:~$ ssh jt2006@ogg.cs.bath.ac.uk
```

and enter your password (note it does not show). If you cannot successfully sign in, please email Tom Haines requesting access.
